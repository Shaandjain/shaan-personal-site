    {"title": "MLB Money Printer", "url": "https://github.com/Shaandjain/mlb-money-printer", "tags": ["Data Engineering", "ML", "Sports Analytics", "Kelly Criterion"], "description": "A full end-to-end MLB betting recommendation engine that identifies statistical edges against sportsbook moneylines and uses the Kelly Criterion for optimal bet sizing. I built a comprehensive data pipeline that ingests and aggregates virtually every MLB statistic available—team-level metrics, pitcher-on-pitcher splits, batter-vs-pitcher history, bullpen performance, park factors, run differentials, advanced sabermetrics, and historical betting-line movements. These features feed into a predictive model that estimates true win probabilities, then compares them against sportsbook lines to detect edges. The system calculates recommended wagers using the Kelly Criterion, adjusting bet size based on the magnitude of each edge. During the 2024 season, following its daily recommendations turned $10 into $200 in one month. The project required combining data engineering, statistical modeling, machine learning, and real product deployment—I built the pipeline, the model, the API, and a Vercel frontend that automatically surfaces the most +EV bets each day. This remains my most exciting project because it demonstrates how data-driven insights can uncover meaningful advantages in real-world financial-style decision-making."},
